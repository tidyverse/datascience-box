The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and 
explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. Hundreds 
of trends have been tracked since 1972. In addition, since the GSS adopted 
questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.

The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal 
questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil 
liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending 
priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic 
events.

In this assignment we analyze data from the 2016 GSS, using it to estimate values 
of population parameters of interest about US adults.[^1]

# Packages

In this assignment we will work with the following packages. They should already 
be installed in your project, and you can load them with the following:

```{r load-packages, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
```

# Data

As we mentioned above, we will work with the 2016 GSS data. The dataset is called `gss`. You can find descriptions of each of the variables in the help file for the dataset, which you can access by running `?gss` in your Console.

# Exercises

## Part 1: Harrassment at work

In 2016, the GSS added a new question on harrassment at work. The question is 
phrased as the following.

>*Over the past five years, have you been harassed by your superiors or co-workers at your job, for example, have you experienced any bullying, physical or psychological abuse?*

Answers to this question are stored in the `harass5` variable in our dataset.

1. What are the possible responses to this question and how many respondents 
chose each of these answers?

2. What percent of the respondents for whom this question is applicable  
(i.e. excluding `NA`s and `Does not apply`s) have been harassed by their superiors 
or co-workers at their job.

## Part 2: Time spent on email

The 2016 GSS also asked respondents how many hours and minutes they spend on 
email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and 
`emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.5 hrs, this would be 
recorded as `emailhr = 2` and `emailmin = 30`.

3. Create a new variable called `email` that combines these two variables to 
reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.

4. Visualize the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median 
number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a 
better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?

5. Create another new variable, `snap_insta` that is coded as "Yes" if the 
respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), 
and "No" if not. If the recorded value was `NA` for both of these questions, 
the value in your new variable should also be `NA`.

6. Calculate the percentage of Yes's for `snap_insta` among those who answered 
the question, i.e. excluding `NA`s.

7. What are the possible responses to the question *Last week were you working full time, part time, going to school, keeping house, or what?* and how many respondents 
chose each of these answers? Note that this information is stored in the `wrkstat` 
variable.

8. Fit a model predicting `email` (number of minutes per week spent on email) 
from `educ` (number of years of education), `wrkstat`, and `snap_insta`. 
Interpret the slopes for each of these variables.

9. Create a predicted values vs. residuals plot for this model. Are there any 
issues with the model? If yes, describe them.

## Part 3: Political views and science research

The 2016 GSS also asked respondents whether they think of themselves as liberal 
or conservative (`polviews`) and whether they think science research is necessary 
and should be supported by the federal government (`advfront`).

- The question on science research is worded as follows:

>Even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research that advances the frontiers of knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the federal government.

And possible responses to this question are Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, 
Strongly disagree, Dont know, No answer, Not applicable.

- The question on political views is worded as follows:

> We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I'm going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal--point 1--to extremely conservative--point 7. Where would you place yourself on this scale?

```{marginfigure}
Note that the levels of this variables are spelled inconsistently: "Extremely liberal" vs. "Extrmly conservative". Since this is the spelling that shows up in the data, you need to make sure this is how you spell the levels in your code.
```

And possible responses to this question are Extremely liberal, Liberal, Slightly 
liberal, Moderate, Slghtly conservative, Conservative, Extrmly conservative. 
Responses that were originally Don't know, No answer and Not applicable are 
already mapped to `NA`s upon data import.

10. In a new variable, recode `advfront` such that Strongly Agree and Agree are 
mapped to `"Yes"`, and Disagree and Strongly disagree are mapped to `"No"`. The 
remaining levels can be left as is. Don't overwrite the existing `advfront`, 
instead pick a different, informative name for your new variable.

11. In a new variable, recode `polviews` such that Extremely liberal, Liberal, 
and Slightly liberal, are mapped to `"Liberal"`, and Slghtly conservative, 
Conservative, and Extrmly conservative disagree are mapped to `"Conservative"`. 
The remaining levels can be left as is. Make sure that the levels are 
in a reasonable order. Don't overwrite the existing `polviews`, 
instead pick a different, informative name for your new variable.

12. Create a visualization that displays the relationship between these two 
new variables and interpret it.

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` `r emo::ji("arrow_up")` *Now is definitely a good time to knit your document, and commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards, and review the .md document on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work. Then go get some rest!*
