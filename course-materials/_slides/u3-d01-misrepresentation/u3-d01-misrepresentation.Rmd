## Original study

Moore, Steven C., et al. **["Association of leisure-time physical activity with risk of 26 types of cancer in 1.44 million adults."](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2521826)** JAMA internal medicine 176.6 (2016): 816-825.

- **Volunteers** were **asked** about their physical activity level over the preceding year. 
- Half exercised less than about 150 minutes per week, half exercised more. 
- Compared to the bottom 10% of exercisers, the top 10% had lower rates of esophageal, liver, lung, endometrial, colon, and breast cancer.
- Researchers found no association between exercising and 13 other cancers (e.g. pancreatic, ovarian, and brain).

# Visualising uncertainty

On December 19, 2014, the front page of Spanish national newspaper El
País read *"Catalan public opinion swings toward 'no' for independence, says survey"*.

```{r echo=FALSE}

  rate     = c(45.3, 44.5, 10.2)
) %>%
  mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, "No", "Yes", "No answer"))
```

```{r catalan-misleading, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(catalan, aes(y = fct_rev(response), x = rate, color = response, group = response)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = rate, 
                   y = fct_rev(response), yend = fct_rev(response)),
               linewidth = 1) +
