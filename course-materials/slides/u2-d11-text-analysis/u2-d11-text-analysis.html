# Tidytext analysis

## Packages

In addition to `tidyverse` we will be using four other packages today


```r
library(tidytext)
library(readxl)
library(wordcloud)
library(DT)
```

---

## Tidytext

- Using tidy data principles can make many text mining tasks easier, more effective, and consistent with tools already in wide use.
- Learn more at https://www.tidytextmining.com/.

## What is tidy text?


```r
text &lt;- c("Take me out tonight",
          "Where there's music and there's people",
          "And they're young and alive",
          "Driving in your car",
          "I never never want to go home",
          "Because I haven't got one",
          "Anymore")

text

## Stop words

- In computing, stop words are words which are filtered out before or after processing of natural language data (text).
- They usually refer to the most common words in a language, but there is not a single list of stop words used by all natural language processing tools.

- One way to analyze the sentiment of a text is to consider the text as a combination of its individual words 
- and the sentiment content of the whole text as the sum of the sentiment content of the individual words

sheeran_lyrics %&gt;%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %&gt;%
  count(sentiment, word) %&gt;%
  group_by(sentiment) %&gt;%
  top_n(10) 
```

```
## # A tibble: 20 × 3
## # Groups:   sentiment [2]
##   sentiment word        n
##   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;
## 1 negative  break      28
## 2 negative  broken     21
## 3 negative  cold       45
## 4 negative  drunk      27
## 5 negative  fall       54
## 6 negative  falling    29
## # … with 14 more rows
```
]

---

### Step 2: `ungroup()`

.midi[

```r
sheeran_lyrics %&gt;%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %&gt;%
  count(sentiment, word) %&gt;%
  group_by(sentiment) %&gt;%
  top_n(10) %&gt;%
  ungroup()
```

```
## # A tibble: 20 × 3
##   sentiment word        n
##   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;
## 1 negative  break      28
## 2 negative  broken     21
## 3 negative  cold       45
## 4 negative  drunk      27
## 5 negative  fall       54
## 6 negative  falling    29
## # … with 14 more rows
```
]

---

### Step 3: Save the result


```r
sheeran_top10 &lt;- sheeran_lyrics %&gt;%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %&gt;%
  count(sentiment, word) %&gt;%
  group_by(sentiment) %&gt;%
  top_n(10) %&gt;%
  ungroup()
```

---

class: middle

**Goal:** Visualize the top 10 most common words with positive and negative sentiments.

---

### Step 1: Create a bar chart

.midi[

```r
sheeran_top10 %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = word, y = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col()
```

&lt;img src="u2-d11-text-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

### Step 2: Order bars by frequency

.midi[

```r
sheeran_top10 %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col()
```

&lt;img src="u2-d11-text-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

### Step 3: Facet by sentiment

.midi[

```r
sheeran_top10 %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ sentiment)
```

&lt;img src="u2-d11-text-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

### Step 4: Free the scales!

.midi[

```r
sheeran_top10 %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ sentiment, scales = "free")
```

&lt;img src="u2-d11-text-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

### Step 4: Flip the coordinates

.midi[

```r
sheeran_top10 %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ sentiment, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()
```

&lt;img src="u2-d11-text-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

### Step 5: Clean up labels

.small[

```r
sheeran_top10 %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ sentiment, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Sentiments in Ed Sheeran's lyrics", x = "", y = "")
```

&lt;img src="u2-d11-text-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

### Step 6: Remove redundant info

.small[

```r
sheeran_top10 %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ sentiment, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Sentiments in Ed Sheeran's lyrics", x = "", y = "") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) 
```

```
## Warning: `guides(&lt;scale&gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use
## `guides(&lt;scale&gt; = "none")` instead.
```

## Scoring sentiments

---

## Assign a sentiment score

.small[

```r
sheeran_lyrics %&gt;%
  anti_join(stop_words) %&gt;%
  left_join(get_sentiments("afinn")) 
```

```
## # A tibble: 11,861 × 5

  filter(!is.na(value)) %&gt;%
  group_by(album) %&gt;%
  summarise(total_sentiment = sum(value)) %&gt;%
  arrange(total_sentiment)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 × 2
