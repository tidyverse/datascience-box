# Why should you care about data types?

---

## Example: Cat lovers

A survey asked respondents their name and number of cats. The instructions said to enter the number of cats as a numerical value.


```r
cat_lovers &lt;- read_csv("data/cat-lovers.csv")
```


```
## # A tibble: 60 x 3
##   name           number_of_cats handedness
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;     
## 1 Bernice Warren 0              left      
## 2 Woodrow Stone  0              left      
## 3 Willie Bass    1              left      
## 4 Tyrone Estrada 3              left      
## 5 Alex Daniels   3              left      
## 6 Jane Bates     2              left      
## # … with 54 more rows
```

## Oh why won't you work?!


```r
cat_lovers %&gt;%
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))
```

```
## Warning in mean.default(number_of_cats): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##   mean_cats

## 1        NA
```

```r

## Always you need to respect data types


```r
cat_lovers %&gt;%
  mutate(
    number_of_cats = case_when(
      name == "Ginger Clark" ~ "2",
      name == "Doug Bass"    ~ "3",

## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##   mean_cats
##       &lt;dbl&gt;

## Now that we know what we're doing...


```r
*cat_lovers &lt;- cat_lovers %&gt;%
  mutate(
    number_of_cats = case_when(
      name == "Ginger Clark" ~ "2",
      name == "Doug Bass"    ~ "3",
      TRUE                   ~ number_of_cats
      ),
    number_of_cats = as.numeric(number_of_cats)
    )
```

---

## Moral of the story

- If your data does not behave how you expect it to, type coercion upon reading in the data might be the reason.
- Go in and investigate your data, apply the fix, *save your data*, live happily ever after.

.hand-blue[learning about data types in R]

&lt;br&gt;

.hand-blue[let's learn about data types in R!]

---

class: middle

# Data types

---

## Data types in R

- **logical**
- **double**
- **integer**
- **character**
- and some more, but we won't be focusing on those

---

## Logical &amp; character

.pull-left[
**logical** - boolean values `TRUE` and `FALSE`


```r
typeof(TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```
]
.pull-right[
**character** - character strings


```r
typeof("hello")
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
]

---

## Double &amp; integer

.pull-left[
**double** - floating point numerical values (default numerical type)


```r
typeof(1.335)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

```r
typeof(7)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```
]
.pull-right[
**integer** - integer numerical values (indicated with an `L`)


```r
typeof(7L)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

```r
typeof(1:3)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```
]

---

## Concatenation

Vectors can be constructed using the `c()` function.


```r
c(1, 2, 3)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

```r
c("Hello", "World!")
```

```
## [1] "Hello"  "World!"
```

```r
c(c("hi", "hello"), c("bye", "jello"))
```

```
## [1] "hi"    "hello" "bye"   "jello"
```

---

## Converting between types

.hand[with intention...]

.pull-left[

```r
x &lt;- 1:3
x
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

```r
typeof(x)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

```r
y &lt;- as.character(x)
y
```

```
## [1] "1" "2" "3"
```

```r
typeof(y)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
]
--
.pull-right[

```r
x &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE)
x
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE
```

```r
typeof(x)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```

```r
y &lt;- as.numeric(x)
y
```

```
## [1] 1 0
```

```r
typeof(y)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```
]

---

## Converting between types

.hand[without intention...]

R will happily convert between various types without complaint when different types of data are concatenated in a vector, and that's not always a great thing!

.pull-left[

```r
c(1, "Hello")
```

```
## [1] "1"     "Hello"
```

```r
c(FALSE, 3L)
```

```
## [1] 0 3
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
c(1.2, 3L)
```

```
## [1] 1.2 3.0
```

```r
c(2L, "two")
```

```
## [1] "2"   "two"
```
]

---

## Explicit vs. implicit coercion

Let's give formal names to what we've seen so far:

- **Explicit coercion** is when you call a function like `as.logical()`, `as.numeric()`, `as.integer()`, `as.double()`, or `as.character()`.
- **Implicit coercion** happens when you use a vector in a specific context that expects a certain type of vector. 

---

.midi[
.your-turn[
- [RStudio Cloud](http://rstd.io/dsbox-cloud) &gt; `AE 06 - Hotels + Data types` &gt; open `type-coercion.Rmd` and knit.
- What is the type of the given vectors? First, guess. Then, try it out in R. 
If your guess was correct, great! If not, discuss why they have that type.
]
]

.small[
**Example:** Suppose we want to know the type of `c(1, "a")`. First, I'd look at: 

.pull-left[

```r
typeof(1)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
typeof("a")
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
]

and make a guess based on these. Then finally I'd check:
.pull-left[

```r
typeof(c(1, "a"))
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
]
]

# Special values

---

## Special values

- `NA`: Not available
- `NaN`: Not a number
- `Inf`: Positive infinity
- `-Inf`: Negative infinity

--

.pull-left[

```r
pi / 0
```

```
## [1] Inf
```

```r
0 / 0
```

```
## [1] NaN
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
1/0 - 1/0
```

```
## [1] NaN
```

```r
1/0 + 1/0
```

```
## [1] Inf
```
]

---

## `NA`s are special ❄️s


```r
x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA)
```


```r
mean(x)
```

```
## [1] NA
```

```r
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 2.5
```

```r
summary(x)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
##    1.00    1.75    2.50    2.50    3.25    4.00       1
```

---

## `NA`s are logical

R uses `NA` to represent missing values in its data structures.


```r
typeof(NA)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```

---

## Mental model for `NA`s

- Unlike `NaN`, `NA`s are genuinely unknown values
- But that doesn't mean they can't function in a logical way
- Let's think about why `NA`s are logical...

--

.question[
Why do the following give different answers?
]
.pull-left[

```r
# TRUE or NA
TRUE | NA
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
# FALSE or NA
FALSE | NA
```

```
## [1] NA
```
]

`\(\rightarrow\)` See next slide for answers...

---

- `NA` is unknown, so it could be `TRUE` or `FALSE`

.pull-left[
.midi[
- `TRUE` or `TRUE` is `TRUE` and `TRUE` or `FALSE` is also `TRUE`, and since both are `TRUE`

```r
TRUE | TRUE
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
FALSE | TRUE
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```
]
]

.pull-right[
.midi[
- `FALSE` or `TRUE` is `TRUE` and `FALSE` or `FALSE` is also `FALSE`, so you you can't tell which should be the right answer

```r
FALSE | TRUE
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
FALSE | FALSE
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```
]
]

- Doesn't make sense for mathematical operations but make sense in the context of missing data

# Data classes

---

## Data classes

We talked about *types* so far, next we'll introduce the concept of *classes*

- Vectors are like Lego building blocks
- We stick them together to build more complicated constructs, e.g. *representations of data*
- The **class** attribute relates to the S3 class of an object which determines its behaviour
  - You don't need to worry about what S3 classes really mean, but you can read more about it [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html#s3-classes) if you're curious
- Examples: factors, dates, and data frames
  
---

## Factors

R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values


```r
x &lt;- factor(c("BS", "MS", "PhD", "MS"))
x
```

```
## [1] BS  MS  PhD MS 
## Levels: BS MS PhD
```

.pull-left[

```r
typeof(x)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
class(x)
```

```
## [1] "factor"
```
]


---

## More on factors

We can think of factors like character (level labels) and an integer (level numbers) glued together


```r
glimpse(x)
```

```
##  Factor w/ 3 levels "BS","MS","PhD": 1 2 3 2
```

```r
as.integer(x)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 2
```

---

## Dates


```r
y &lt;- as.Date("2020-01-01")
y
```

```
## [1] "2020-01-01"
```

```r
typeof(y)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

```r
class(y)
```

```
## [1] "Date"
```

---

## More on dates

We can think of factors like an integer (the number of days since the origin, 1 Jan 1970) and an integer (the origin) glued together


```r
as.integer(y)
```

```
## [1] 18262
```

```r
as.integer(y) / 365 # roughly 50 yrs
```

```
## [1] 50.03288
```

---

## Data frames

We can think of data frames like like vectors of equal length glued together


```r
df &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)
df
```

```
##   x y
## 1 1 3
## 2 2 4
```

.pull-left[

```r
typeof(df)
```

```
## [1] "list"
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
class(df)
```

```
## [1] "data.frame"
```
]

---

## Lists

Lists are a generic vector container vectors of any type can go in them


```r
l &lt;- list(
  x = 1:4,
  y = c("hi", "hello", "jello"),
  z = c(TRUE, FALSE)
)
l
```

```
## $x
## [1] 1 2 3 4
## 
## $y
## [1] "hi"    "hello" "jello"
## 
## $z
## [1]  TRUE FALSE
```

---

## Lists and data frames

- A data frame is a special list containing vectors of equal length
- When we use the `pull()` function, we extract a vector from the data frame


```r
df
```

```
##   x y
## 1 1 3
## 2 2 4
```

```r
df %&gt;%
  pull(y)
```

```
## [1] 3 4
```

## Step 1. Put together dates.

.midi[

```r

  select(starts_with("arrival_"))
```

## Step 2. Count number of bookings per date.

.midi[

```r
hotels %&gt;%
  mutate(arrival_date = glue("{arrival_date_year} {arrival_date_month} {arrival_date_day_of_month}")) %&gt;%
  count(arrival_date)

## 1 2015 August 1    110
## 2 2015 August 10   207
## 3 2015 August 11   117
## 4 2015 August 12   133
## 5 2015 August 13   107
## 6 2015 August 14   329
## # … with 787 more rows
```
]

## Step 3. Visualise number of bookings per date.

.midi[

```r
hotels %&gt;%
  mutate(arrival_date = glue("{arrival_date_year} {arrival_date_month} {arrival_date_day_of_month}")) %&gt;%
  count(arrival_date) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = arrival_date, y = n, group = 1)) +
  geom_line()
```

## Step 1. `REVISED` Put together dates `as dates`.

.midi[

```r

## 2              2015 July                                    27                        1 2015-07-01  
## 3              2015 July                                    27                        1 2015-07-01

## Step 2. Count number of bookings per date.

.midi[

```r
hotels %&gt;%
  mutate(arrival_date = ymd(glue("{arrival_date_year} {arrival_date_month} {arrival_date_day_of_month}"))) %&gt;% 
  count(arrival_date)
```

```
## # A tibble: 793 x 2
##   arrival_date     n
##   &lt;date&gt;       &lt;int&gt;
## 1 2015-07-01     122
## 2 2015-07-02      93
## 3 2015-07-03      56
## 4 2015-07-04      88

## 6 2015-07-06      75
## # … with 787 more rows

## Step 3a. Visualise number of bookings per date.

.midi[

```r
hotels %&gt;%
  mutate(arrival_date = ymd(glue("{arrival_date_year} {arrival_date_month} {arrival_date_day_of_month}"))) %&gt;% 
  count(arrival_date) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = arrival_date, y = n, group = 1)) +
  geom_line()
```

&lt;img src="u1_d08-data-types_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-58-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

## Step 3b. Visualise using a smooth curve.

.midi[

```r
hotels %&gt;%
  mutate(arrival_date = ymd(glue("{arrival_date_year} {arrival_date_month} {arrival_date_day_of_month}"))) %&gt;% 
  count(arrival_date) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = arrival_date, y = n, group = 1)) +
* geom_smooth()
```
