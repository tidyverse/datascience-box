# Data classes and types

---

## Data types in R

* **logical**
* **double**
* **integer**
* **character**
* **lists**
* and some more, but we won't be focusing on those

---

## Logical &amp; character

.pull-left[
**logical** - boolean values `TRUE` and `FALSE`


```r
typeof(TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```
]
.pull-right[
**character** - character strings


```r
typeof("hello")
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
]

---

## Double &amp; integer

.pull-left[
**double** - floating point numerical values (default numerical type)


```r
typeof(1.335)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

```r
typeof(7)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```
]
.pull-right[
**integer** - integer numerical values (indicated with an `L`)


```r
typeof(7L)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

```r
typeof(1:3)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```
]

---

## Lists

**Lists** are 1d objects that can contain any combination of R objects

.pull-left[
.midi[

```r
mylist &lt;- list(
  "A", 
  1:4, 
  c(TRUE, FALSE), 
  (1:4)/2
  )
mylist
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "A"
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 1 2 3 4
## 
## [[3]]
## [1]  TRUE FALSE
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0
```
]
]
.pull-right[

```r
str(mylist)
```

```
## List of 4
##  $ : chr "A"
##  $ : int [1:4] 1 2 3 4
##  $ : logi [1:2] TRUE FALSE
##  $ : num [1:4] 0.5 1 1.5 2
```
]

---

## Named lists

Because of their more complex structure we often want to name the elements of a list (we 
can also do this with vectors). This can make reading and accessing the list more 
straight forward.

.pull-left[

```r
myotherlist &lt;- list(
  A = "hello", 
  B = 1:4, 
  "knock knock" = "who's there?"
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
.midi[

```r
str(myotherlist)
```

```
## List of 3
##  $ A          : chr "hello"
##  $ B          : int [1:4] 1 2 3 4
##  $ knock knock: chr "who's there?"
```

```r
names(myotherlist)
```

```
## [1] "A"           "B"           "knock knock"
```

```r
myotherlist$B
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4
```
]
]

---

## Concatenation

Vectors can be constructed using the `c()` function.


```r
c(1, 2, 3)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

```r
c("Hello", "World!")
```

```
## [1] "Hello"  "World!"
```

```r
c(1, c(2, c(3)))
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

---


## Vectors vs. lists

.pull-left[

```r
x &lt;- c(8,4,7)
```

```r
x[1]
```

```
## [1] 8
```

```r
x[[1]]
```

```
## [1] 8
```
]
--
.pull-right[

```r
y &lt;- list(8,4,7)
```

```r
y[2]
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 4
```

```r
y[[2]]
```

```
## [1] 4
```
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Note:** When using tidyverse code you'll rarely need to refer to elements using square brackets, but it's good to be aware of this syntax, especially since you might encounter it when searching for help online.

---

&lt;img src="img/hadley-salt-pepper.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Type coercion

R will happily convert between the various types without complaint.


```r
c(1, "Hello")
```

```
## [1] "1"     "Hello"
```

```r
c(FALSE, 3L)
```

```
## [1] 0 3
```

```r
c(1.2, 3L)
```

```
## [1] 1.2 3.0
```

--

...and that's not alwas a great thing!

---

## Missing Values

R uses `NA` to represent missing values in its data structures.


```r
typeof(NA)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```

---

## `NA`s are special ❄️s


```r
x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA)
```


```r
mean(x)
```

```
## [1] NA
```

```r
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 2.5
```

```r
summary(x)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
##    1.00    1.75    2.50    2.50    3.25    4.00       1
```


---

## Other Special Values

`NaN` - Not a number

`Inf` - Positive infinity

`-Inf` - Negative infinity

--

.pull-left[

```r
pi / 0
```

```
## [1] Inf
```

```r
0 / 0
```

```
## [1] NaN
```

```r
1/0 + 1/0
```

```
## [1] Inf
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
1/0 - 1/0
```

```
## [1] NaN
```

```r
NaN / NA
```

```
## [1] NaN
```

```r
NaN * NA
```

```
## [1] NaN
```
]

.small[
**Example:** Suppose we want to know the type of `c(1, "a")`. First, I'd look at: 

.pull-left[

```r
typeof(1)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
typeof("a")
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
]

and make a guess based on these. Then finally I'd check:
.pull-left[

```r
typeof(c(1, "a"))
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
]
]

---

## Example: Cat lovers

A survey asked respondents their name and number of cats. The instructions said to enter the number of cats as a numerical value.


```r
cat_lovers &lt;- read_csv("data/cat-lovers.csv")
```


```
## # A tibble: 60 x 3

##  2 Woodrow Stone  0              left      
##  3 Willie Bass    1              left

## Moral of the story

- If your data does not behave how you expect it to, type coercion upon reading in the data might be the reason.
- Go in and investigate your data, apply the fix, *save your data*, live happily ever after.

# Data "set"

---

## Data "sets" in R

- "set" is in quotation marks because it is not a formal data class
--

- A tidy data "set" can be one of the following types:
    + `tibble`
    + `data.frame`
--
- We'll often work with `tibble`s:
    + `readr` package (e.g. `read_csv` function) loads data as a `tibble` by default
    + `tibble`s are part of the tidyverse, so they work well with other packages we are using
    + they make minimal assumptions about your data, so are less likely to cause hard to track bugs in your code

---

## Data frames

- A data frame is the most commonly used data structure in R: it is a list of equal length vectors. 
--

- Each vector is treated as a column and elements of the vectors as rows.
--

- A tibble is a type of data frame that makes your life (i.e. data analysis) easier.

---

## Constructing data frames

- Most often a data frame will be constructed by reading in from a file
- But we can also create them from scratch.

.midi[
.pull-left[

```r
df &lt;- tibble(
  x = 1:3, 
  y = c("a", "b", "c")
  )
class(df)
```

```
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
```

```r
glimpse(df)
```

```
## Rows: 3
## Columns: 2
## $ x &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3
## $ y &lt;chr&gt; "a", "b", "c"
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
df &lt;- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
  1,  "a",
  2,  "b",
  3,  "c"
)
df
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##       x y    
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;
## 1     1 a    
## 2     2 b    
## 3     3 c
```
]
]

```

```
## [1] 60
```

.discussion[

## to conlcude discussion on data frames / tibbles...

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="img/tibble-part-of-tidyverse.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
.pull-right[
- **tibble** is also the name of the Tidyverse package that implements this data type
- But you rarely need to directly load this package since `library(tidyverse)` takes care of it
- And you rarely need to use functions from this package for data wrangling and visualisation, except when you're manually creating your data frames for a short example with `tibble()` or `tribble()`
]

---

## Recap

- Always best to think of data as part of a tibble
    + This plays nicely with the `tidyverse` as well
    + Rows are observations, columns are variables
--
- Be careful about data types / classes
    + Sometimes `R` makes silly assumptions about your data class 
        + Using `tibble`s help, but it might not solve all issues
        + Think about your data in context, e.g. 0/1 variable is most likely a `factor`
    + If a plot/output is not behaving the way you expect, first
    investigate the data class
    + If you are absolutely sure of a data class, overwrite it in your
    tibble so that you don't need to keep having to keep track of it
        + `mutate` the variable with the correct class

# Factors

---

## Factors

Factor objects are how R stores data for categorical variables (fixed numbers of discrete values).


```r
(x = factor(c("BS", "MS", "PhD", "MS")))
```

```
## [1] BS  MS  PhD MS 
## Levels: BS MS PhD
```


```r
glimpse(x)
```

```
##  Factor w/ 3 levels "BS","MS","PhD": 1 2 3 2
```


```r
typeof(x)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

---

## Read data in as character strings


```r
glimpse(cat_lovers)
```

```
## Rows: 60
## Columns: 3
## $ name           &lt;chr&gt; "Bernice Warren", "Woodrow Stone", "Willie Bass", "Tyrone Estrad…
## $ number_of_cats &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1…
## $ handedness     &lt;chr&gt; "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", …
```

---

## But coerce when plotting


```r
ggplot(cat_lovers, mapping = aes(x = handedness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

&lt;img src="u1_d08-data-types_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png" width="70%" /&gt;

---

## Use forcats to manipulate factors


```r
cat_lovers %&gt;%
* mutate(handedness = fct_infreq(handedness)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = handedness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/forcats-part-of-tidyverse.png" width="70%" /&gt;

- R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values
- Factors are useful when you have true categorical data and you want to override the ordering of character vectors to improve display
- They are also useful in modeling scenarios
- The **forcats** package provides a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors

- It's not one of the *core* tidyverse packages, hence it's installed with `install.packages("tidyverse)` but it's not loaded with it, and needs to be explicitly loaded with `library(lubridate)`

### Step 2. Count number of bookings per date.

.midi[

```r

  mutate(arrival_date = glue("{arrival_date_year} {arrival_date_month} {arrival_date_day_of_month}")) %&gt;%
  count(arrival_date)

##  1 2015 August 1    110
##  2 2015 August 10   207
##  3 2015 August 11   117
##  4 2015 August 12   133
##  5 2015 August 13   107
##  6 2015 August 14   329
##  7 2015 August 15   190
##  8 2015 August 16    98
##  9 2015 August 17   188
## 10 2015 August 18    94
## # … with 783 more rows

### Step 3. Visualise number of bookings per date.

.midi[

```r
hotels %&gt;%
  mutate(arrival_date = glue("{arrival_date_year} {arrival_date_month} {arrival_date_day_of_month}")) %&gt;%
  count(arrival_date) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = arrival_date, y = n, group = 1)) +

```

&lt;img src="u1_d08-data-types_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-63-1.png" width="2700" /&gt;

### Step 3b. Visualise using a smooth curve.

.midi[

```r

  mutate(arrival_date = ymd(glue("{arrival_date_year} {arrival_date_month} {arrival_date_day_of_month}"))) %&gt;% 
  count(arrival_date) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = arrival_date, y = n, group = 1)) +
* geom_smooth() +
  ylim(0, 450)
```
