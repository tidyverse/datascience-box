# Inference

.question[
What does inference mean?
]

--

- Statistical inference is the process of using sample data to make conclusions about the underlying population the sample came from
- Types of inference: testing and estimation
- Today we discuss estimation, next time testing

# Confidence intervals

## Confidence intervals

A plausible range of values for the population parameter is a **confidence interval**.

.pull-left[
![spear](img/spear.png)
]
.pull-right[
![net](img/net.png)
]

- If we report a point estimate, we probably won’t hit the exact population parameter.

- If we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter.

---

## Variability of sample statistics

- In order to construct a confidence interval we need to quantify the variability of our sample statistic.

- For example, if we want to construct a confidence interval for a population mean, we need to come up with a plausible range of values around our observsed sample mean.

- This range will depend on how precise and how accurate our sample mean is as an estimate of the population mean.

- Quantifying this requires a measurement of how much we would expect the sample mean to vary from sample to sample.
    
.question[
👤 Suppose you randomly sample 50 students and 5 of them are left handed. If you were to take another random sample of 50 students, how many would you expect to be left handed? Would you be surprised if only 3 of them were left handed? Would you be surprised if 40 of them were left handed?

## Quantifying the variability of a sample statistic

We can quantify the variability of sample statistics using

- simulation: via bootstrapping (today)

or

- theory: via Central Limit Theorem (later in the course)

# Bootstrapping

---

## Bootstrapping

&lt;img src="img/boot.png" style="float:right"&gt;

- The term **bootstrapping** comes from the phrase "pulling oneself up by one’s 
bootstraps", which is a metaphor for accomplishing an impossible task without 
any outside help.

- In this case the impossible task is estimating a population parameter, and we’ll 
accomplish it using data from only the given sample.

- Note that this notion of saying something about a population parameter using 
only information from an observed sample is the crux of statistical inference, 
it is not limited to bootstrapping.

## Bootstrapping scheme

1. Take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken with replacement from the 
original sample, of the same size as the original sample.

2. Calculate the bootstrap statistic - a statistic such as mean, median, 
proportion, slope, etc. computed on the bootstrap samples.

3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) many times to create a bootstrap distribution - 
a distribution of bootstrap statistics.

4. Calculate the bounds of the XX% confidence interval as the middle XX% 
of the bootstrap distribution.

## New package: `infer`

The objective of this package is to perform statistical inference using an expressive statistical grammar that coheres with the tidyverse design framework.

![ht-diagram](img/ht-diagram.png)


```r
# install.packages("infer")
library(infer)
```

Also, let's set a seed:


```r
set.seed(20180307)
```

## Generate bootstrap medians


```r
manhattan %&gt;%
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = rent)
```

---

## Generate bootstrap medians


```r
manhattan %&gt;%
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = rent)
  # generate 15000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap")
```

---

## Generate bootstrap medians


```r
manhattan %&gt;%
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = rent)
  # generate 15000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap")
  # calculate the median of each bootstrap sample
  calculate(stat = "median")
```

---

## Generate bootstrap medians


```r
# save resulting bootstrap distribution
rent_ci_med &lt;- manhattan %&gt;%
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = rent) %&gt;% 
  # generate 15000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") %&gt;% 
  # calculate the median of each bootstrap sample
  calculate(stat = "median")
```

## The bootstrap sample

.question[
👤 How many observations are there in `rent_ci_med`? What does each observation represent?
]


```r
glimpse(rent_ci_med)
```

```
## Observations: 15,000
## Variables: 2
## $ replicate &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1...

```

## Visualize the bootstrap distribution


```r
ggplot(data = rent_ci_med, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50) +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution of medians")
```

## Calculate the confidence interval

A 95% confidence interval is bounded by the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution.

.small[

```r
rent_ci_med %&gt;%
  summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   lower_bound upper_bound

## 1       2162.       2875.

## Interpret the confidence interval

.question[
👥 The 95% confidence interval for the median rent of one bedroom apartments in Manhattan was calculated as (2162.5, 2875). Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this interval?
]

(a) 95% of the time the median rent one bedroom apartments in this sample is between $2162.5 and $2875.

(b) 95% of all one bedroom apartments in Manhattan have rents between $2162.5 and $2875.

(c) We are 95% confident that the median rent of all one bedroom apartments is between $2162.5 and $2875.

(d) We are 95% confident that the median rent one bedroom apartments in this sample is between $2162.5 and $2875.

## Confidence level

**We are 95% confident that ...**

- Suppose we took many samples from the original population and built a 95% confidence interval based on each sample.

- Then about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.

## Commonly used confidence levels

Commonly used confidence levels in practice are 90%, 95%, and 99%

## Calculating confidence intervals at various confidence levels

.question[

  specify(response = rent) %&gt;% 
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") %&gt;% 
  calculate(stat = "median") %&gt;%
  summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
```

## Recap

- Sample statistic `\(\ne\)` population parameter, but if the sample is good, it can be a good estimate.

- We report that estimate with a confidence bound around it, and the width of this bound depends on how variable sample statistics from different samples from the population would be.

- Since we can't continue sampling from the population, we instead bootstrap from the one sample we have to estimate the sampling variability.

- We can do this for any sample statistic:
  - We did it for a median today, `calculate(stat = "median")`
  - Doing it for a mean would just take `calculate(stat = "mean")`
  - And you'll learn about calculating bootstrap intervals for other statistics in lab tomorrow
