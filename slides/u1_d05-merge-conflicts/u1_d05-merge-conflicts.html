## Merge conflicts

- When two collaborators make changes to a file and push the file to their repo, git merges these two files.
- If these two files have conflicting content on the same line, git will produce a **merge conflict**.

---

## Getting started

- Clone the repo for your next assignment in RStudio, and open the .Rmd file.
- Assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to each of the team members.

---

## Let's cause a merge conflict

Take turns in completing the exercise, only one member at a time. For now, only commit and push the Rmd file:

.midi[
- Member 1 - Change the team name to your actual team name, knit, commit, push.
- Member 2 - Change the team name to some other word, knit, commit, push. You should get an error. Pull. Take a look at the document with the merge conflict. Clear the merge conflict by choosing the correct/preferred change. Commit, and push.
- Member 3 - Add a name to the first code chunk, knit, commit, push. You should get an error. Pull. No merge conflicts should occur. Now push.
- Member 4 - Add a different name to the first code chunk, knit, commit, push. You should get an error. Pull. Take a look at the document with the merge conflict. Clear the merge conflict by choosing the correct/preferred change. Commit, and push.
- All members - Pull, and observe the changes in your document.
]

## Tips for collaborating via GitHub

- Always pull first before you start working.
- Commit, and push, often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve.
- If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions asap, don't let it linger and get bigger.
