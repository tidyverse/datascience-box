# Tidy regression output

Let's revisit the model predicting heights of paintings from their widths:


```r
pp &lt;- read_csv("../../data/paris-paintings.csv", 
               na = c("n/a", "", "NA"))
```


```r
m_ht_wt &lt;- lm(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp)
```

## Not-so-tidy regression output

- You might come accross these in your googling adventures, but we'll try to stay away from them

- Not because they are wrong, but because they don't result in tidy data frames as results.

## Review

.question[
What makes a data frame tidy?
]

--

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

---

## Tidy regression output

Achieved with functions from the broom package:

- `tidy`: Constructs a data frame that summarizes the model's statistical findings: coefficient estimates, *standard errors, test statistics, p-values*.

- `augment`: Adds columns to the original data that was modeled. This includes predictions and residuals.

- `glance`: Constructs a concise one-row summary of the model. This typically contains values such as `\(R^2\)`, adjusted `\(R^2\)`, *and residual standard error that are computed once for the entire model*.

## Transforming the data

- We saw that `price` has a right-skewed distribution, and the relationship between price and width of painting is non-linear.

--

- In these situations a transformation applied to the response variable may be useful.

--

- In order to decide which transformation to use, we should examine the distribution of the response variable.

--

- The extremely right skewed distribution suggests that a log transformation may 
be useful.
    - log = natural log, `\(ln\)`
    - Default base of the `log` function in R is the natural log: &lt;br&gt;
    `log(x, base = exp(1))`

## Interpreting models with log transformation


```r
m_lprice_wt &lt;- lm(log(price) ~ Width_in, data = pp_wt_lt_100)
m_lprice_wt %&gt;%
  tidy() %&gt;%
  select(term, estimate) %&gt;%
  mutate(estimate = round(estimate, 3))
```

```
##          term estimate
## 1 (Intercept)    4.669
## 2    Width_in    0.019
```

---

## Linear model with log transformation

$$ \widehat{log(price)} = 4.67 + 0.02 Width $$

--

- For each additional inch the painting is wider, the log price of the
painting is expected to be higher, on average, by 0.02 livres.

--

- which is not a very useful statement...

---

## Working with logs

- Subtraction and logs: `\(log(a) − log(b) = log(a / b)\)`

--

- Natural logarithm: `\(e^{log(x)} = x\)`

--

- We can use these identities to "undo" the log transformation

---

## Interpreting models with log transformation

The slope coefficient for the log transformed model is 0.02, meaning the log 
price difference between paintings whose widths are one inch apart is predicted 
to be 0.02 log livres.

--

$$ log(\text{price for width x+1}) - log(\text{price for width x}) = 0.02 $$

--

$$ log\left(\frac{\text{price for width x+1}}{\text{price for width x}}\right) = 0.02 $$

--

$$ e^{log\left(\frac{\text{price for width x+1}}{\text{price for width x}}\right)} = e^{0.02} $$

--

$$ \frac{\text{price for width x+1}}{\text{price for width x}} \approx 1.02 $$

--

For each additional inch the painting is wider, the price of the
painting is expected to be higher, on average, by a factor of 1.02.

## Shortcuts in R

  tidy() %&gt;%
  select(term, estimate) %&gt;%
  mutate(estimate = round(estimate, 3))

```
##          term estimate
## 1 (Intercept)    4.669
## 2    Width_in    0.019
```


```r
m_lprice_wt %&gt;%
  tidy() %&gt;%
  select(term, estimate) %&gt;%
  mutate(estimate = round(exp(estimate), 3))
```

```
##          term estimate
## 1 (Intercept)  106.540
## 2    Width_in    1.019
```

## Recap

- Non-constant variance is one of the most common model violations, however it 
is usually fixable by transforming the response (y) variable.

--

- The most common transformation when the response variable is right skewed is 
the log transform: `\(log(y)\)`, especially useful when the response variable is 
(extremely) right skewed.

--

- This transformation is also useful for variance stabilization.

--

- When using a log transformation on the response variable the interpretation of 
the slope changes: *"For each unit increase in x, y is expected on average to be higher/lower &lt;br&gt; by a factor of `\(e^{b_1}\)`."*

--

- Another useful transformation is the square root: `\(\sqrt{y}\)`, especially 
useful when the response variable is counts.

---

## Transform, or learn more?

- Data transformations may also be useful when the relationship is non-linear

- However in those cases a polynomial regression may be more appropriate
  + This is beyond the scope of this course, but you’re welcomed to try it for your final project, and I’d be happy to provide further guidance

---

## Aside: when `\(y = 0\)`

In some cases the value of the response variable might be 0, and


```r
log(0)
```

```
## [1] -Inf
```

--

The trick is to add a very small number to the value of the response variable for these cases so that the `log` function can still be applied:


```r
log(0 + 0.00001)
```

```
## [1] -11.51293
```

## Price, surface area, and living artist

.question[
What is the typical surface area for paintings?
]

![](p2_d03-model-nonlinear_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--

Less than 1000 square inches (which is roughly a painting that is 31in x 31in). There are very few paintings that have surface area above 5000 square inches.

---

## Price, surface area, and living artist

For simplicity let's focus on the paintings with `Surface &lt; 5000`:

![](p2_d03-model-nonlinear_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Price vs. surface and living artist

.question[
Does the relationship between surface and logged price vary by whether or not
the artist is living?
]

.small[

```r
ggplot(data = pp_Surf_lt_5000,
       mapping = aes(y = log(price), x = Surface, 
                     color = factor(artistliving))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(color = "Living artist")
```

]

---

## Modelling with main effects 


```r
m_main &lt;- lm(log(price) ~ Surface + factor(artistliving), 
             data = pp_Surf_lt_5000)
m_main %&gt;%
  tidy() %&gt;%
  select(term, estimate) %&gt;%
  mutate(estimate = round(estimate, 5))
```

```
##                    term estimate
## 1           (Intercept)  4.88008
## 2               Surface  0.00027
## 3 factor(artistliving)1  0.13721
```

--

Linear model:

$$ \widehat{log(price)} = 4.88 + 0.00027~surface + 0.14~artistliving $$

--

- Plug in 0 for `artistliving` to get the linear model for paintings by non-living
artists.

- Plug in 1 for `artistliving` to get the linear model for paintings by living
artists.

---

## Interpretation of main effects

.pull-left[
![](p2_d03-model-nonlinear_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

.pull-right[
- Non-living artist: 
`\(\widehat{log(price)} = 4.88 + 0.00027~surface + 0.14 \times 0\)`
`\(= 4.88 + 0.00027~surface\)`

- Living artist: 
`\(\widehat{log(price)} = 4.88 + 0.00027~surface + 0.14 \times 1\)`
`\(= 5.02 + 0.00027~surface\)`
]

- Rate of change in price as the surface area of the painting increases does 
not vary between paintings by living and non-living artists (same slope), 

- Paintings by living artists are consistently more expensive than paintings by
non-living artists (different intercept).
