<div id="setting-up-your-course-in-rstudio-cloud" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up your course in RStudio Cloud</h2>
<p>First, create a new workspace on RStudio Cloud. By default, this new workspace will be a private workspace. All it takes to create a new workspace is a name and brief information for the space. You can update the information once the space is created, however you can’t change the name of the space. For the name,<br />
I recommend using something along the lines of Course number - Semester.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-new-workspace.png" alt="Creating a new workspace on RStudio Cloud" />
<p class="caption">Creating a new workspace on RStudio Cloud</p>
</div>
<p>Next step is to invite members to the workspace. You can do this by sending invitations or using a sharing link. I recommend using the latter approach for efficiency. Once all of your students are in the course (or once drop/add period ends) you can change the settings so that additional members cannot join throughout the semester using the sharing link, and can only be added via an invitation from the instructor.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-workspace-permissions.png" alt="Setting workspace permissions" />
<p class="caption">Setting workspace permissions</p>
</div>
<p>As highlighted in the figure above, when a workspace is set to accept members via a shared link, the owner can also set a default permission level for those entering the workspace via the sharing link. Suggested permission levels and suggestions for mapping to course roles are as follows.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>RStudio Cloud role</th>
<th>Permissions</th>
<th>Course role</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Admin</td>
<td>Manage users, view, edit and manage all projects</td>
<td>Instructor</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Moderator</td>
<td>View, edit and manage all projects</td>
<td>Teaching Assistant</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Contributor</td>
<td>Create, edit and manage their own projects</td>
<td>Student</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Viewer</td>
<td>View projects shared with everyone</td>
<td>Auditor, Visitor</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This set of permissions will allow instructors full access including management of users. Teaching assistants will be able to peek into student projects, which can ve very useful when helping troubleshoot. Students won’t be able to see each others’ projects. Students auditing your course or visitors, such as colleagues wanting to view/experience your course setup will have limited access.</p>
<p>RStudio Cloud also allows you to specify who can see the list of members. Admins and moderators can, by default, see all members of the workspace. I prefer to allow contributors (students) to see the list of members and viewers (auditors and visitors) to not since course enrollment information should not be available to non-official members of the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="projects" class="section level2">
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>A project in RStudio Cloud is equivalent to an RStudio project. If you are an RStudio user, but you don’t use projects, I highly recommend considering switching your workflow to include projects. You can learn more about them <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#rstudio-projects">here</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-new-project.png" alt="A new project in RStudio Cloud is a new project in the RStudio IDE" />
<p class="caption">A new project in RStudio Cloud is a new project in the RStudio IDE</p>
</div>
<div id="access" class="section level3">
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>When you create a new project in your workspace, it is by default visible only to you plus the admins and moderators of the space. This default has two advantages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It allows you to develop a project semi-privately and actively decide when the project is ready to be shared with students. This can be especially beneficial when developing an assessment like an exam.</li>
<li>It means when a student creates a project in the workspace it’s not, by default, visible to other students.</li>
</ol>
<p>When your project is ready to be shared with the students in your course, you can adjust the access level by clicking on the gear icon to reveal the settings menu.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-project-permissions.png" alt="Setting project permissions within a workspace" />
<p class="caption">Setting project permissions within a workspace</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="copying" class="section level3">
<h3>Copying</h3>
<p>When a student clicks on your shared project, they are notified that this is a temporary copy (with red blinking text), and are given the option to make their own permanent copy of the project. This is the first thing a student should do when they start working on a project.</p>
<p>When a student makes a copy of a project, a new project where they are the owner and that is only visible to them (and the admins and moderators of the space) is created. This copy contains all documents included in the original project and has all the packages installed (but not loaded) as well.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-project-copy.png" alt="Making a copy of a project" />
<p class="caption">Making a copy of a project</p>
</div>
<p>You will see in the above screenshot that the user (on the right) is not the admin of the course. This screenshot was taken when logged into the demo workspace as a student (contributor). I strongly recommend that instructors make a second account for themselves on RStudio Cloud and add that user as a contributor to the workspace to be see what your students see when they log in. It’s a great way to test out functionality and resolve unexpected issues your students might encounter, before they encounter them. I recommend using an incognito browser window for the student account so that you can stay logged in both as a student and as the instructor at the same time and test the student view as you develop content as an instructor.</p>
<p>One huge advantage of your students working in RStudio Cloud is that you as the instructor, and anyone with an admin and moderator role, can peek into student projects. While it is important for your students to learn to ask questions in a way that does not depend on someone else being able to see their work directly (and for this I strongly recommend teaching students to make <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex">reprexes</a>), it is sometimes, especially early on, nice to be able to peek into a student’s project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="base-project-template" class="section level2">
<h2>Base project template</h2>
<p>If you consistently use a particular set of packages and/or need a particular set of documents to be included in each project, the base project template functionality will come in very handy. You can use this by defining a base project template for the space. Simply create a new project and add any packages or files you want projects created in the space to start with. After creating your project, select it on the Settings page as the base project template.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-base-template.png" alt="Selecting a base project template" />
<p class="caption">Selecting a base project template</p>
</div>
<p>Note that a project must be shared with everyone in the space in order to be used as a template; only projects which are viewable by everyone in the space will appear in the templates list.</p>
</div>
<div id="git-integration" class="section level2">
<h2>Git integration</h2>
<p>It is possible to create (clone) a new project in RStudio Cloud from a GitHub repository, just like in the RStudio IDE.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-git-project.png" alt="Creating a new project from GitHub repository" />
<p class="caption">Creating a new project from GitHub repository</p>
</div>
<p>If you have a base project template set up for your workspace, this new project created from GitHub will also have the packages installed in the base project template.</p>
<p>For more on using Git and GitHub in the classroom, see <a href="here" class="uri">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="limits" class="section level2">
<h2>Limits</h2>
<div id="memory" class="section level3">
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>Each project on RStudio Cloud is allocated 1 GB of RAM. While this is a pretty generous limit, actions like joining large tables or fitting complicated models could exceed the limit.</p>
<p>I recommend testing out the any work you assign, especiallty those using large datasets, in order to avoid unexpected hiccups due to out of memory issues. One challenge is that you might have no control over what issues students might run into if they are working on an open ended project using a dataset of their own choice. In these circumstances it’s helpful to keep in the back of your mind that one way an out of memory issue can present itself is with the RStudio Cloud project crashing.</p>
</div>
<div id="users-projects" class="section level3">
<h3>Users / projects</h3>
<p>Another limit that you will most likely hit when setting up your course on RStudio Cloud is that each account is allocated one private space, with up to three members and five projects. Once you hit this limit RStudio Cloud will prompt you to submit a request to the RStudio Cloud team for more capacity. Rest assured that this request will be approved.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="rstudio-cloud-is-in-alpha" class="section level2">
<h2>RStudio Cloud is in alpha!</h2>
<p>RStudio Cloud in alpha. The development team is still adding important features and improving performance, reliability and availability. If you have any questions or feedback, you can reach out on the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/c/rstudio-cloud">RStudio Community</a>.</p>
