What are the three most common first names of purchasers?\n\n2.  What are the three most common themes of Lego sets purchased?\n\n3.  Among the most common theme of Lego sets purchased, what is the most common subtheme?\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

Create a new variable called `age_group` and group the ages into the following categories: \"18 and under\", \"19 - 25\", \"26 - 35\", \"36 - 50\", \"51 and over\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Hint:** You will need to consider quantity of purchases.\n```\n:::\n\n\n5.  Which age group has purchased the highest number of Lego sets.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Hint:** You will need to consider quantity of purchases as well as price of lego sets.\n```\n:::\n\n\n6.  Which age group has spent the most money on Legos?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Hint:** The [`str_sub()`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_sub.html) function will be helpful here!\n```\n:::\n\n\n7.  Which Lego theme has made the most money for Lego?\n\n8.  Which area code has spent the most money on Legos?\n    In the US the area code is the first 3 digits of a phone number.\n\n9.  Come up with a question you want to answer using these data, and write it down.\n    Then, create a data visualization that answers the question, and explain how your visualization answers the question.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards and review the md document on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work.*\n",
