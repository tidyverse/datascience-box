How many pairings are there between all Denny's and all La Quinta locations in Alaska, i.e. how many distances do we need to calculate between the locations of these establishments in Alaska?\n\nIn order to calculate these distances we need to first restructure our data to pair the Denny's and La Quinta locations.\nTo do so, we will join the two data frames.\nWe have six join options in R.\nEach of these join functions take at least three arguments: `x`, `y`, and `by`.\n\n-   `x` and `y` are data frames to join\n-   `by` is the variable(s) to join by\n\nFour of these join functions combine variables from the two data frames:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\nThese are called **mutating joins**.\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   `inner_join()`: return all rows from `x` where there are matching values in `y`, and all columns from `x` and `y`.\n\n-   `left_join()`: return all rows from `x`, and all columns from `x` and `y`.\n    Rows in x with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns.\n\n-   `right_join()`: return all rows from `y`, and all columns from `x` and `y`.\n    Rows in y with no match in x will have NA values in the new columns.\n\n-   `full_join()`: return all rows and all columns from both `x` and `y`.\n    Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.\n\nAnd the other two join functions only keep cases from the left-hand data frame, and are called **filtering joins**.\nWe'll learn about these another time but you can find out more about the join functions in the help files for any one of them, e.g. `?full_join`.\n\nIn practice we mostly use mutating joins.\nIn this case we want to keep all rows and columns from both `dn_ak` and `lq_ak` data frames.\nSo we will use a `full_join`.\n\n![Full join of Denny's and La Quinta locations in AK](img/dennys-laquinta-sketches/dennys-laquinta-sketches.004.png){height=\"300px\" width=\"300px\"}\n\nLet's join the data on Denny's and La Quinta locations in Alaska, and take a look at what it looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndn_lq_ak <- full_join(dn_ak, lq_ak, by = \"state\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in full_join(dn_ak, lq_ak, by = \"state\"): Detected an unexpected many-to-many relationship between `x` and `y`.\nℹ Row 1 of `x` matches multiple rows in `y`.\nℹ Row 1 of `y` matches multiple rows in `x`.\nℹ If a many-to-many relationship is expected, set `relationship =\n  \"many-to-many\"` to silence this warning.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndn_lq_ak\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n  address.x     city.x state zip.x longitude.x latitude.x address.y city.y zip.y\n  <chr>         <chr>  <chr> <chr>       <dbl>      <dbl> <chr>     <chr>  <chr>\n1 2900 Denali   Ancho… AK    99503       -150.       61.2 3501 Min… \"\\nAn… 99503\n2 2900 Denali   Ancho… AK    99503       -150.       61.2 4920 Dal… \"\\nFa… 99709\n3 3850 Debarr … Ancho… AK    99508       -150.       61.2 3501 Min… \"\\nAn… 99503\n4 3850 Debarr … Ancho… AK    99508       -150.       61.2 4920 Dal… \"\\nFa… 99709\n5 1929 Airport… Fairb… AK    99701       -148.       64.8 3501 Min… \"\\nAn… 99503\n6 1929 Airport… Fairb… AK    99701       -148.       64.8 4920 Dal… \"\\nFa… 99709\n# ℹ 2 more variables: longitude.y <dbl>, latitude.y <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n4.  How many observations are in the joined `dn_lq_ak` data frame? What are the names of the variables in this data frame.\n\n`.x` in the variable names means the variable comes from the `x` data frame (the first argument in the `full_join` call, i.e. `dn_ak`), and `.y` means the variable comes from the `y` data frame.\nThese varibles are renamed to include `.x` and `.y` because the two data frames have the same variables and it's not possible to have two variables in a data frame with the exact same name.\n\nNow that we have the data in the format we wanted, all that is left is to calculate the distances between the pairs.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

What function from the tidyverse do we use the add a new variable to a data frame while keeping the existing variables?\n\nOne way of calculating the distance between any two points on the earth is to use the Haversine distance formula.\nThis formula takes into account the fact that the earth is not flat, but instead spherical.\n\nThis function is not available in R, but we have it saved in a file called `haversine.R` that we can load and then use:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhaversine <- function(long1, lat1, long2, lat2, round = 3) {\n  # convert to radians\n  long1 = long1 * pi / 180\n  lat1  = lat1  * pi / 180\n  long2 = long2 * pi / 180\n  lat2  = lat2  * pi / 180\n  \n  R = 6371 # Earth mean radius in km\n  \n  a = sin((lat2 - lat1)/2)^2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin((long2 - long1)/2)^2\n  d = R * 2 * asin(sqrt(a))\n  \n  return( round(d,round) ) # distance in km\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis function takes five arguments:\n\n-   Longitude and latitude of the first location\n-   Longitude and latitude of the second location\n-   A parameter by which to round the responses\n\n6.  Calculate the distances between all pairs of Denny's and La Quinta locations and save this variable as `distance`.\n    Make sure to save this variable in THE `dn_lq_ak` data frame so that you can use it later.\n\n7.  Calculate the minimum distance between a Denny's and La Quinta for each Denny's location.\n    To do so we group by Denny's locations and calculate a new variable that stores the information for the minimum distance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndn_lq_ak_mindist <- dn_lq_ak %>%\n  group_by(address.x) %>%\n  summarise(closest = min(distance))\n```\n:::\n\n\n8.  Describe the distribution of the distances Denny's and the nearest La Quinta locations in Alaska. Also include an appripriate visualization and relevant summary statistics.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

Repeat the same analysis for North Carolina: (i) filter Denny's and La Quinta Data Frames for NC, (ii) join these data frames to get a completelist of all possible pairings, (iii) calculate the distances between all possible pairings of Denny's and La Quinta in NC, (iv) find the minimum distance between each Denny's and La Quinta location, (v) visualize and describe the distribution of these shortest distances using appropriate summary statistics.\n\n10. Repeat the same analysis for Texas.\n\n11. Repeat the same analysis for a state of your choosing, different than the ones we covered so far.\n\n12. Among the states you examined, where is Mitch Hedberg's joke most likely to hold true?\n    Explain your reasoning.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.
