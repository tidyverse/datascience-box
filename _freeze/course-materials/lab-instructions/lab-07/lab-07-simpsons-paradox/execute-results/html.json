What type of study do you think these data come from: observational or experiment?\n    Why?\n\n2.  How many observations are in this dataset?\n    What does each observation represent?\n\n3.  How many variables are in this dataset?\n    What type of variable is each?\n    Display each variable using an appropriate visualization.\n\n4.  What would you expect the relationship between smoking status and health outcome to be?\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*\n\n5.  Create a visualization depicting the relationship between smoking status and health outcome. Briefly describe the relationship, and evaluate whether this meets your expectations. Additionally, calculate the relevant conditional probabilities to help your narrative. Here is some code to get you started:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nWhickham %>%\n  count(smoker, outcome)\n```\n:::\n\n\n6.  Create a new variable called `age_cat` using the following scheme:\n\n-   `age <= 44 ~ \"18-44\"`\n-   `age > 44 & age <= 64 ~ \"45-64\"`\n-   `age > 64 ~ \"65+\"`\n\n7.  Re-create the visualization depicting the relationship between smoking status and health outcome, faceted by `age_cat`. What changed? What might explain this change? Extend the contingency table from earlier by breaking it down by age category and use it to help your narrative.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nWhickham %>%\n  count(smoker, age_cat, outcome)\n```\n:::\n\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards and review the md document on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work.*\n",
