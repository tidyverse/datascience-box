Comprised of an astonishing range of objects and ideas spanning two millennia and a multitude of artistic forms, the collection reflects not only the long and rich trajectory of the University, but also major national and international shifts in art history.\"*[^lab-08-uoe-art-1].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\nSee the sidebar [here](https://collections.ed.ac.uk/art) and note that there are 2970 pieces in the art collection we're collecting data on. Note that more pieces may have been added or some pieces may have been removed between when this lab was written and when you're working on it.\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn this lab we'll scrape data on all art pieces in the [Edinburgh College of Art collection](https://collections.ed.ac.uk/art/search/*:*/Collection:%22edinburgh+college+of+art%7C%7C%7CEdinburgh+College+of+Art%22).\n\n# Learning goals\n\n-   Working with R scripts\n-   Web scraping from a single page\n-   Writing functions\n-   Iteration by mapping functions\n-   Writing data out\n\n# Lab prep\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.margin='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/selectorgadget.png){width=89}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Download and install the SelectorGadget for your browser.\n    Once you do, you should now be able to access SelectorGadget by clicking on the icon next to the search bar in your Chrome or Firefox browser.\n\n    -   See [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb) for Chrome (recommended)\n    -   See [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chropath-for-firefox) for Firefox\n\n-   Read the following on working with R Markdown documents vs. R scripts.\n\n## R scripts vs. R Markdown documents\n\nToday we will be using both R scripts and R Markdown documents:\n\n-   `.R`: R scripts are plain text files containing **only** code and brief comments,\n\n    -   We'll use R scripts in the web scraping stage and ultimately save the scraped data as a csv.\n\n-   `.Rmd`: R Markdown documents are plain text files containing.\n\n    -   We'll use an R Markdown document in the web analysis stage, where we start off by reading in the csv file we wrote out in the scraping stage.\n\nHere is the organization of your repo, and the corresponding section in the lab that each file will be used for:\n\n\n```{=plain}\n|-data\n|  |- README.md\n|-lab-06-uoe-art.Rmd              # analysis\n|-lab-06-uoe-art.Rproj\n|-README.md\n|-scripts                         # webscraping\n|  |-

organization and locate your homework repo, clone it in RStudio and open the R Markdown document.\nKnit the document to make sure it compiles without errors.\n\n## Warm up\n\nLet's warm up with some simple exercises.\nUpdate the YAML of your R Markdown file with your information, knit, commit, and push your changes.\nMake sure to commit with a meaningful commit message.\nThen, go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd **and** md files.\nIf anything is missing, commit and push again.\n\n## Packages\n\nWe'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation, the **robotstxt** package to check if we're allowed to scrape the data, the **rvest** package for data scraping.\nThese packages are already installed for you.\nYou can load them by running the following in your Console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(robotstxt)\nlibrary(rvest)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\nThis assignment does not come with any prepared datasets.\nInstead you'll be scraping the data!\nBut before doing so, let's check that a bot has permissions to access pages on this domain.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

define a new object called `first_url`, which is the link above.\nThen, we read the page at this url with the `read_html()` function from the **rvest** package.\nThe code for this is already provided in `01-scrape-page-one.R`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set url\nfirst_url <-

the ten pieces on this page we will extract `title`, `artist`, and `link` information, and put these three variables in a data frame.\n\n### Titles\n\nLet's start with titles.\nWe make use of the

Click on one of art piece titles in your browser and take note of the url of the webpage it takes you to. Think about how that url compares to what we scraped above? How is it different? Using `str_replace()`, fix the URLs. You'll note something special happening in the `pattern` to replace. We want to replace the `.`, but we have it as `\\\\.`. This is because the period `.` is a special character and so we need to escape it first with backslashes, `\\\\`s.\n\n### Artists\n\n2.  Fill in the blanks to scrape artist names.\n\n### Put it altogether\n\n3.  Fill in the blanks to organize everything in a tibble.\n\n### Scrape the next page\n\n4.

Fill in the blanks to construct the list of URLs.\n\n### Mapping\n\nFinally, we're ready to iterate over the list of URLs we constructed.\nWe will do this by **map**ping the function we developed over the list of URLs.\nThere are a series of mapping functions in R (which we'll learn about in more detail tomorrow), and they each take the following form:\n\n    map([x], [function to apply to each element of x])\n\nIn our case `x` is the list of URLs we constructed and the function to apply to each element of `x` is the function we developed earlier, `scrape_page`.\nAnd as a result we want a data frame, so we use `map_dfr` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dfr(urls, scrape_page)\n```\n:::\n\n\n7.  Fill in the blanks to scrape all pages, and to create a new data frame called `uoe_art`.\n\n### Write out data\n\n8.  Finally write out the data frame you constructed into the `data` folder so that you can use it in the analysis section.\n\n::: {.marker}\nAim to make it to this point during the workshop.\n:::\n\n✅ ⬆️ If you haven't done so recently, c*ommit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

You'll need to use that trick again.\n```\n:::\n\n\n9.  Fill in the blanks in to implement the data wrangling we described above. Note that this will result in some warnings when you run the code, and that's OK! Read the warnings, and explain what they mean, and why we are ok with leaving them in given that our objective is to just capture `year` where it's convenient to do so.\n10. Print out a summary of the data frame using the `skim()` function. How many pieces have artist info missing? How many have year info missing?\n11. Make a histogram of years. Use a reasonable binwidth. Do you see anything out of the ordinary?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Hint:** You'll want to use `mutate()` and `if_else()` or `case_when()` to implement the correction.\n```\n:::\n\n\n12. Find which piece has the out of the ordinary year and go to its page on the art collection website to find the correct year for it. Can you tell why our code didn't capture the correct year information? Correct the error in the data frame and visualize the data again.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ *If you haven't done so recently, knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*\n\n13. Who is the most commonly featured artist in the collection? Do you know them? Any guess as to why the university has so many pieces from them?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.marginfigure .cell-code}\n**Hint:** `str_subset()` can be helful here.
