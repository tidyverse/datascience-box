Proposal - due \\[ENTER DUE DATE\\]\n2.  Presentation - due \\[ENTER DUE DATE\\]\n3.  Executive summary - due \\[ENTER DUE DATE\\]\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis is a draft of the introduction section of your project as well as a data analysis plan and your dataset.\n\n-   **Section 1 - Introduction:** The introduction should introduce your general\n\n    research question and your data (where it came from, how it was collected,\n\n    what are the cases, what are the variables, etc.).\n\n-   **Section 2 - Data:** Place your data in the \\`/data\\` folder, and add dimensions and codebook to the README in that folder.\n    Then print out the output of and codebook to the README in that folder.\n    Then print out the output of `glimpse()` or `skim()` of your data frame.\n\n-   **Section 3 - Data analysis plan:**\n\n    -   The outcome (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question.\n\n    -   The comparison groups you will use, if applicable.\n\n    -   Very preliminary exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data.\n        (You can add to these later as you work on your project.)\n\n    -   The method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s).\n        (You can update these later as you work on your project.)\n\n    -   What results from these specific statistical methods are needed to support your hypothesized answer?\n\nEach section should be no more than 1 page (excluding figures).\nYou can check a print preview to confirm length.\n\nThe grading scheme for the project proposal is as follows.\nNote that after you receive feedback for your proposal you can improve it based on the feedback and re-submit it.\nIf you re-submit, your final score for the proposal will be the average of two scores you receive (first and second submission).\n\n| Total                                | 10 pts |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| Data                                 | 3 pts  |\n| Proposal                             | 5 pts  |\n| Workflow, organization, code quality | 1 pt   |\n| Teamwork                             | 1 pt   |\n\n### Presentation\n\n5 minutes maximum, and each team member should say something substantial.\nYou can either present live during your workshop or pre-record and submit your video to be played during the workshop.\n\nPrepare a slide deck using the template in your repo.\nThis template uses a package called `xaringan`, and allows you to make presentation slides using R Markdown syntax.\nThere isn't a limit to how many slides you can use, just a time limit (5 minutes total).\nEach team member should get a chance to speak during the presentation.\nYour presentation should not just be an account of everything you tried (\"then we did this, then we did this, etc.\"), instead it should convey what choices you made, and why, and what you found.\n\nBefore you finalize your presentation, make sure your chunks are turned off with `echo = FALSE`.\n\nPresentations will take place during the last workshop of the semester.\nYou can choose to do your presentation live or pre-record it.\nDuring your workshop you will watch presentations from other teams in your workshop and provide feedback in the form of peer evaluations.\nThe presentation line-up will be generated randomly.\n\nThe grading scheme for the presentation is as follows:\n\n| Total                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 50 pts |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Time management: Did the team divide the time well amongst themselves or got cut off going over time?                                                                                                          | 4 pts  |\n| Content: Is the research question well designed and is the data being used relevant to the research question?                                                                                                  | 5 pts  |\n| Professionalism: How well did the team present?

Did everyone get a chance to say something meaningful about the project?                                    | 5 pts  |\n| Teamwork: Did the team present a unified story, or did it seem like independent pieces of work patched together?                                                                                               | 6 pts  |\n| Content: Did the team use appropriate statistical procedures and interpretations of results accurately?                                                                                                        | 10 pts |\n| Creativity and Critical Thought: Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered?

Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\n\nA general breakdown of scoring is as follows:\n\n-   90%-100% - Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.\n-   80%-89% - Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.\n-   70%-79% - Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n-   60%-69% - Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\n-   Below 60% - Student is not making a sufficient effort.\n\n### Team peer evaluation\n\nYou will be asked to fill out a survey where you rate the contribution and teamwork of each team member out of 10 points.\nYou will additionally report a contribution percentage for each team member.\nFilling out the survey is a prerequisite for getting credit on the team member evaluation.If you are suggesting that an individual did less than 20% of the work, please provide some explanation.\nIf any individual gets an average peer score indicating that they did less than 10% of the work, this person will receive half the grade of the rest of the group.\n\n### Late work policy\n\n-   There is no late submission / make up for the presentation. You must be in class on the day of the presentation to get credit for it *or* pre-record and submit your presentation by 9am in the morning of the presentations.\n-   The late work policy for the write-up is 5% of the maximum obtainable mark per calendar day up to seven calendar days after the deadline. If you intend to submit work late for the project, you must notify the course organizer before the original deadline as well as as soon as the completed work is submitted on GitHub.\n",
