title: "Interactive tutorials"
---

The following interactive tutorials have been built with [**learnr**](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/publishing.html) and [**gradethis**](https://rstudio-education.github.io/gradethis/).
They're available on shinyapps.io (linked) as well as distributed with the [**dsbox**](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/tutorials/index.html) package.[^1]
With the dsbox package installed, you can also run these tutorials in the Tutorials pane of your RStudio window.
This might be preferable for courses with high enrollment where students need to access the tutorials at the same time.

Note that many of these include examples and questions from the homework assignments listed earlier.
You can think of these as interactive, auto-feedback versions of the simpler questions in the homework assignments.
If using both the tutorials and the homework assignments in your teaching, I recommend modifying the homework assignments to remove the redundant questions (they will usually be the earlier, shorter, simpler questions) and making the homework assignment shorter.
Students will ultimately get exposed to the same material, but get auto-feedback in the tutorials and human feedback on the homework assignments.

If you would like to learn about making your own tutorials with learnr, I strongly recommend reviewing the video and materials from the following 1.5 hour workshop: [Building interactive tutorials in R](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/teach-r-online/).
