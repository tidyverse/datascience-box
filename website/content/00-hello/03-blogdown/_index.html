<p>A nifty tool for building your course website is <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most useful aspect of blogdown in this setting is that your slides,
assignments, etc. written in R Markdown can be automatically rendered, so you
don’t need to separate knit those documents.</p>
<p>More instructions on this are forthcoming, but for the time being, you can use
<a href="https://github.com/Sta199-S18/website">this course website</a> as an example.</p>
