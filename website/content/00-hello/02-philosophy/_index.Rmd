Assuming you like chocolate and strawberries, which of the following images is 
more likely to make you want to learn to bake a cake? I'm guessing the 
answer is the image on the left: the cake.

```{r cake-ingredients, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "../../images/cake-ingredients.png")
```

The teaching philosophy of this course builds on this same idea. We first show 
the students the end result, and then step back and teach the necessary 
components. Specifically, instead of starting with data structurs and functions, 
we start data visualization. And not just a toy example, but a complex, 
multivariate data visualization. Of course, we don't want students feeling like...

```{r owl, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "../../images/owl.jpg")
```

The course goes starts out slow and emphasizes iteration. Students are initially 
provided with lots of scaffolding, and then slowly we take away the scaffolding 
until they are starting with a blank slate for their final projects.
