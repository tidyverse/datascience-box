<p>If you are an instructor we recommend consuming the content in the order presented here: first familiarize yourself with the teaching philosophy, course syllabus, and the tech stack, then browse the course content, and then review the details of the computing infrastructure of the course.</p>
<p>If you are a learner, you might consider jumping straight into the course content.</p>
