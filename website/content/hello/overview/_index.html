<h2>Who is this course for?</h2>
<p>The materials in this box are designed for learners who have no background
in data science, statistics, or programming. However, they also assume that
the learners are interested in making sense of (sometimes messy) data and
willing to dive into the documentation of the packages we introduce.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-does-this-course-fit-in-a-curriculum" class="section level2">
<h2>Where does this course fit in a curriculum?</h2>
<p>This course can serve as a first course in an undergraduate data science or
statistics curriculum. It can also serve as an introductory course in a graduate
program, and depending on the background of the students, earlier topics can
be covered more quickly to make room for more content at the end of the course.</p>

<div id="why-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Why R?</h2>
<p>Unlike most other software designed specifically for teaching statistics, R
is free and open source, powerful, flexible, and relevant beyond the
introductory statistics classroom. Arguments against using and teaching
R at especially the introductory statistics level generally cluster around
the following two points: teaching programming in addition to statistical
concepts is challenging and the command line is more intimidating to beginners
than the graphical user interface (GUI) most point-and-click type software
offer.</p>
<p>One solution for these concerns is to avoid hands-on data analysis completely.
If we do not ask our students to start with raw data and instead always provide
them with small, tidy rectangles of data then there is never really a need for
statistical software beyond spreadsheet or graphing calculator. This is not
what we want in a modern statistics course and is a disservice to students.</p>
<p>Another solution is to use traditional point-and-click software for data
analysis. The typical argument is that the GUI is easier for students to learn
and so they can spend more time on statistical concepts. However, this ignores
the fact that these software tools also have nontrivial learning curves. In
fact, teaching specific data analysis tasks using such software often requires
lengthy step-by-step instructions, with annotated screenshots, for navigating
menus and other interface elements. Also, it is not uncommon that instructions
for one task do not easily extend to another. Replacing such instructions with
just a few lines of R code actually makes the instructional materials more
concise and less intimidating.</p>
<p>Many in the statistics education community are in favor of teaching R (or some
other programming language, like Python) in upper level statistics courses,
however the value of using R in introductory statistics courses is not as widely
accepted. We acknowledge that this addition can be burdensome, however we would
argue that learning a tool that is applicable beyond the introductory statistics
course and that enhances students’ problem solving skills is a burden worth
bearing.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-not-language-x" class="section level2">
<h2>Why not language X?</h2>
<p>There are a number of other great programming tools out there that can also be
used for introducing students to data science, e.g. Python. These materials are
designed for teaching data science with R. A great example of a similar
curriculum using Python is <a href="http://data8.org/">Data 8</a> designed at Universit of
California, Berkeley.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Why RStudio?</h2>
<p>The RStudio IDE includes a viewable environment, a file browser, data viewer,
and a plotting pane, which makes it less intimidating than the bare R shell.
Additionally, since it is a full fledged IDE, it also features integrated help,
syntax highlighting, and context-aware tab completion, which are all powerful
tools that help flatten the learning curve. RStudio also has direct integration
with other critically important tools for teaching computing best practices and
reproducible research.</p>
<p>Our recommendation is that students access the RStudio IDE through a centralized
RStudio server instance or using RStudio Cloud. We describe this in further
detail in the Infrasture section.</p>
<p>It should be noted that we do not want to completely dissuade students from
downloading and installing R and RStudio locally, we just do not want it to be
a prerequisite for getting started. We have found that teaching personal setup
is best done progressively throughout a semester, usually via one-on-one
interactions during office hours or after class. Our goal is that all students
will be able to continue using R in any setting.</p>
