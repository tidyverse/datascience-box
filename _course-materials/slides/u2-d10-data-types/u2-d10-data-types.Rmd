# Why should you care about data types?

---

## Example: Cat lovers

A survey asked respondents their name and number of cats. The instructions said to enter the number of cats as a numerical value.

```{r message=FALSE}
cat_lovers <- read_csv("data/cat-lovers.csv")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat_lovers
```

---

## Oh why won't you work?!

```{r}
cat_lovers %>%
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))
```

---

```{r eval=FALSE}
?mean
```

```{r echo=FALSE, caption="Help for mean", out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mean-help.png")
```

---

## Oh why won't you still work??!!

```{r}
cat_lovers %>%
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

## Take a breath and look at your data

.question[
What is the type of the `number_of_cats` variable?
]

```{r}
glimpse(cat_lovers)
```

---

## Let's take another look

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE}
options(htmltools.preserve.raw = FALSE)
cat_lovers %>%
  datatable()
```
]

---

## Sometimes you might need to babysit your respondents

.midi[
```{r}
cat_lovers %>%
  mutate(number_of_cats = case_when(
    name == "Ginger Clark" ~ 2,
    name == "Doug Bass"    ~ 3,
    TRUE                   ~ as.numeric(number_of_cats)
    )) %>%
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))
```
]

---

## Always you need to respect data types

```{r}
cat_lovers %>%
  mutate(
    number_of_cats = case_when(
      name == "Ginger Clark" ~ "2",
      name == "Doug Bass"    ~ "3",
      TRUE                   ~ number_of_cats
      ),
    number_of_cats = as.numeric(number_of_cats)
    ) %>%
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))
```

---

## Now that we know what we're doing...

```{r}
cat_lovers <- cat_lovers %>% #<<
  mutate(
    number_of_cats = case_when(
      name == "Ginger Clark" ~ "2",
      name == "Doug Bass"    ~ "3",
      TRUE                   ~ number_of_cats
      ),
    number_of_cats = as.numeric(number_of_cats)
    )
```

---

## Moral of the story

- If your data does not behave how you expect it to, type coercion upon reading in the data might be the reason.
- Go in and investigate your data, apply the fix, *save your data*, live happily ever after.

# Data types

---

## Data types in R

- **logical**
- **double**
- **integer**
- **character**
- and some more, but we won't be focusing on those

---

## Logical & character

.pull-left[
**logical** - boolean values `TRUE` and `FALSE`

```{r}
typeof(TRUE)
```
]
.pull-right[
**character** - character strings

```{r}
typeof("hello")
```
]

---

## Double & integer

.pull-left[
**double** - floating point numerical values (default numerical type)

```{r}
typeof(1.335)
typeof(7)
```
]
.pull-right[
**integer** - integer numerical values (indicated with an `L`)

```{r}
typeof(7L)
typeof(1:3)
```
]

---

## Concatenation

Vectors can be constructed using the `c()` function.

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3)
c("Hello", "World!")
c(c("hi", "hello"), c("bye", "jello"))
```

---

## Converting between types

.hand[with intention...]

.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- 1:3
x
typeof(x)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
```{r}
y <- as.character(x)
y
typeof(y)
```
]

---

## Converting between types

.hand[with intention...]

.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
x
typeof(x)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
```{r}
y <- as.numeric(x)
y
typeof(y)
```
]

---

## Converting between types

.hand[without intention...]

R will happily convert between various types without complaint when different types of data are concatenated in a vector, and that's not always a great thing!

.pull-left[
```{r}
c(1, "Hello")
c(FALSE, 3L)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
```{r}
c(1.2, 3L)
c(2L, "two")
```
]

---

## Explicit vs. implicit coercion

Let's give formal names to what we've seen so far:

--
- **Explicit coercion** is when you call a function like `as.logical()`, `as.numeric()`, `as.integer()`, `as.double()`, or `as.character()`


--
- **Implicit coercion** happens when you use a vector in a specific context that expects a certain type of vector

---

.midi[
.your-turn[
### .hand[Your turn!]

- RStudio Cloud > `AE 05 - Hotels + Data types` > open `type-coercion.Rmd` and knit.
- What is the type of the given vectors? First, guess. Then, try it out in R. 
If your guess was correct, great! If not, discuss why they have that type.
]
]

--

.small[
**Example:** Suppose we want to know the type of `c(1, "a")`. First, I'd look at: 

.pull-left[
```{r}
typeof(1)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
typeof("a")
```
]

and make a guess based on these. Then finally I'd check:
.pull-left[
```{r}
typeof(c(1, "a"))
```
]
]

# Special values

---

## Special values

- `NA`: Not available
- `NaN`: Not a number
- `Inf`: Positive infinity
- `-Inf`: Negative infinity

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
pi / 0
0 / 0
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
1/0 - 1/0
1/0 + 1/0
```
]

---

## `NA`s are special `r emo::ji('snowflake')`s

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA)
```

```{r}
mean(x)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
summary(x)
```

---

## `NA`s are logical

R uses `NA` to represent missing values in its data structures.

```{r}
typeof(NA)
```

---

## Mental model for `NA`s

- Unlike `NaN`, `NA`s are genuinely unknown values
- But that doesn't mean they can't function in a logical way
- Let's think about why `NA`s are logical...

--

.question[
Why do the following give different answers?
]
.pull-left[
```{r}
# TRUE or NA
TRUE | NA
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
# FALSE or NA
FALSE | NA
```
]

$\rightarrow$ See next slide for answers...

---

- `NA` is unknown, so it could be `TRUE` or `FALSE`

.pull-left[
.midi[
- `TRUE | NA`
```{r}
TRUE | TRUE  # if NA was TRUE
TRUE | FALSE # if NA was FALSE
```
]
]
.pull-right[
.midi[
- `FALSE | NA`
```{r}
FALSE | TRUE  # if NA was TRUE
FALSE | FALSE # if NA was FALSE
```
]
]

- Doesn't make sense for mathematical operations 
- Makes sense in the context of missing data
