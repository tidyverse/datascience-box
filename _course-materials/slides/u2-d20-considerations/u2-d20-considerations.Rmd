## "Can you?" vs "Should you?"

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ok-cupid-1.png")

## Unreliable formatting at the source

## Data broken into many pages

# Workflow

---

## Screen scraping vs. APIs

Two different scenarios for web scraping:

- Screen scraping: extract data from source code of website, with html parser (easy) or regular expression matching (less easy)

- Web APIs (application programming interface): website offers a set of structured http requests that return JSON or XML files

## A new R workflow

- When working in an R Markdown document, your analysis is re-run each time you knit

- If web scraping in an R Markdown document, you'd be re-scraping the data each time you knit, which is undesirable (and not *nice*)!

- An alternative workflow: 
  - Use an R script to save your code 
  - Saving interim data scraped using the code in the script as CSV or RDS files
  - Use the saved data in your analysis in your R Markdown document
