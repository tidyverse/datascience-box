## Amazon's experimental hiring algorithm

- Used AI to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars -- much like shoppers rate products on Amazon
- Amazon's system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way; it taught itself that male candidates were preferable

.pull-left-wide[
>Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models’ judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said.

## ProPublica analysis

### **Data:**

Risk scores assigned to more than 7,000 people arrested in Broward County, Florida, in 2013 and 2014 + whether they were charged with new crimes over the next two years

---

## ProPublica analysis

### **Results:**

- 20% of those predicted to commit violent crimes actually did
- Algorithm had higher accuracy (61%) when full range of crimes taken into account (e.g. misdemeanors)
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/propublica-results.png")
```
- Algorithm was more likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, at almost twice the rate as white defendants
- White defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants

## Parting thoughts

- At some point during your data science learning journey you will learn tools that can be used unethically
- You might also be tempted to use your knowledge in a way that is ethically questionable either because of business goals or for the pursuit of further knowledge (or because your boss told you to do so)

.question[
How do you train yourself to make the right decisions (or reduce the likelihood of accidentally making the wrong decisions) at those points?
