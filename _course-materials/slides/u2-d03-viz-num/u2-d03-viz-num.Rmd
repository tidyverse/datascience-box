# Terminology

---

## Number of variables involved

- Univariate data analysis - distribution of single variable
- Bivariate data analysis - relationship between two variables
- Multivariate data analysis - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others

---

## Types of variables

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

# Data

## Data: Lending Club

.pull-left-wide[

- Thousands of loans made through the Lending Club, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals

- Not all loans are created equal -- ease of getting a loan depends on (apparent) ability to pay back the loan

- Data includes loans *made*, these are not loan applications
]
.pull-right-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lending-club.png")
```
]

## Take a peek at data

```{r output.lines=18}
library(openintro)
glimpse(loans_full_schema)
```

---

## Selected variables

```{r}
loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  select(loan_amount, interest_rate, term, grade, 
         state, annual_income, homeownership, debt_to_income)
glimpse(loans)
```

## Selected variables

<br>

.midi[
variable        | description
----------------|-------------
`loan_amount`   |	Amount of the loan received, in US dollars
`interest_rate` |	Interest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage
`term`	        | The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months
`grade`	        | Loan grade, which takes a values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid
`state`         |	US state where the borrower resides
`annual_income` |	Borrowerâ€™s annual income, including any second income, in US dollars
`homeownership`	| Indicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or rents
`debt_to_income` | Debt-to-income ratio
]

## Variable types

<br>

variable        | type
----------------|-------------
`loan_amount`   |	numerical, continuous
`interest_rate` |	numerical, continuous
`term`	        | numerical, discrete
`grade`	        | categorical, ordinal
`state`         |	categorical, not ordinal
`annual_income` |	numerical, continuous
`homeownership`	| categorical, not ordinal
`debt_to_income` | numerical, continuous

# Visualizing numerical data

## Describing shapes of numerical distributions

- shape:
    - skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    - modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
- center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
- spread: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile range (`IQR`)
- unusual observations

## Histogram

```{r message = TRUE, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

---

## Histograms and binwidth

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[binwidth = 1000]
```{r out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000)

  labs( #<<
    x = "Loan amount ($)", #<<
    y = "Frequency", #<<
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans" #<<
