## Rent in Edinburgh

.question[
Take a guess! How much does a typical 3 BR flat in Edinburgh rents for?
]

---

## Sample

Fifteen 3 BR flats in Edinburgh were randomly selected on rightmove.co.uk.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
edi_3br <- read_csv2("data/edi-3br.csv") # ; separated
```

.small[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
edi_3br
```
]

---

## Observed sample

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = edi_3br, mapping = aes(x = rent)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200) +
  labs(title = "Rent of 3 BR flats in Edinburgh")
```

---

## Observed sample

Sample mean ≈ £`r edi_3br %>% summarise(med_rent = mean(rent)) %>% pull() %>% round()` `r emo::ji("scream")`

<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rent-bootsamp.png")
```

---

## Bootstrap population

Generated assuming there are more flats like the ones in the observed sample... Population mean = `r emo::ji("question")`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rent-bootpop.png")
```

## Bootstrapping scheme

1. Take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken **with replacement** from the 
original sample, of the same size as the original sample
2. Calculate the bootstrap statistic - a statistic such as mean, median, 
proportion, slope, etc. computed on the bootstrap samples
3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) many times to create a bootstrap distribution - 
a distribution of bootstrap statistics
4. Calculate the bounds of the XX% confidence interval as the middle XX% 
of the bootstrap distribution

## Generate bootstrap means

```{r eval=FALSE}
edi_3br %>%
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = rent)
```

---

## Generate bootstrap means

```{r eval=FALSE}
edi_3br %>%
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = rent)
  # generate 15000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap")
```

---

## Generate bootstrap means

```{r eval=FALSE}
edi_3br %>%
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = rent)
  # generate 15000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap")
  # calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

---

## Generate bootstrap means

```{r include=FALSE}
set.seed(834782)
```


```{r}
# save resulting bootstrap distribution
boot_df <- edi_3br %>%
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = rent) %>% 
  # generate 15000 bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  # calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

---

## The bootstrap sample

.question[
How many observations are there in `boot_df`? What does each observation represent?
]

```{r}
boot_df
```

---

## Visualize the bootstrap distribution

```{r}
ggplot(data = boot_df, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution of means")
```

---

## Calculate the confidence interval

A 95% confidence interval is bounded by the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution.

```{r}
boot_df %>%
  summarize(lower = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper = quantile(stat, 0.975))
```

---

## Visualize the confidence interval

```{r include=FALSE}
# for using these values later
lower_bound <- boot_df %>% summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025)) %>% pull() %>% round()
upper_bound <- boot_df %>% summarize(upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975)) %>% pull() %>% round()
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = boot_df, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(lower_bound, upper_bound), color = "#A7D5E8", size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution of means",
       subtitle = "and 95% confidence interval")
```

---

## Interpret the confidence interval

.question[
The 95% confidence interval for the mean rent of three bedroom flats in Edinburgh was calculated as (`r lower_bound`, `r upper_bound`). Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this interval?

**(a)** 95% of the time the mean rent of three bedroom flats in this sample is between £`r lower_bound` and £`r upper_bound`.

**(b)** 95% of all three bedroom flats in Edinburgh have rents between £`r lower_bound` and £`r upper_bound`.

**(c)** We are 95% confident that the mean rent of all three bedroom flats is between £`r lower_bound` and £`r upper_bound`.

**(d)** We are 95% confident that the mean rent of three bedroom flats in this sample is between £`r lower_bound` and £`r upper_bound`.

## Confidence level

**We are 95% confident that ...**

- Suppose we took many samples from the original population and built a 95% confidence interval based on each sample.
- Then about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.

---

## Commonly used confidence levels

.question[
Which line (orange dash/dot, blue dash, green dot) represents which confidence level?
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
l90 <- boot_df %>% summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.05)) %>% round(2) %>% pull()
u90 <- boot_df %>% summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.95)) %>% round(2) %>% pull()

l99 <- boot_df %>% summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.005)) %>% round(2) %>% pull()
u99 <- boot_df %>% summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.995)) %>% round(2) %>% pull()

ggplot(data = boot_df, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(lower_bound, upper_bound), color = "#A7D5E8", lty = 2, size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(l90, u90), color = "chartreuse4", lty = 3, size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(l99, u99), color = "orange", lty = 6, size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution of means",
       subtitle = "and various confidence intervals")
```

## Precision vs. accuracy

.question[
If we want to be very certain that we capture the population parameter, should we use a wider or a narrower interval? What drawbacks are associated with using a wider interval?
]

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/garfield.png")
```

.question[
How can we get best of both worlds -- high precision and high accuracy?
]

---

## Changing confidence level

.question[
How would you modify the following code to calculate a 90% confidence interval? 
How would you modify it for a 99% confidence interval?
]

```{r eval=FALSE}
edi_3br %>%
  specify(response = rent) %>% 
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") %>%
  summarize(lower = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper = quantile(stat, 0.975))
```

## Recap

- Sample statistic $\ne$ population parameter, but if the sample is good, it can be a good estimate
- We report the estimate with a confidence interval, and the width of this interval depends on the variability of sample statistics from different samples from the population
- Since we can't continue sampling from the population, we bootstrap from the one sample we have to estimate sampling variability
- We can do this for any sample statistic:
  - For a mean: `calculate(stat = "mean")`
  - For a median: `calculate(stat = "median")`
  - Learn about calculating bootstrap intervals for other statistics in your homework
