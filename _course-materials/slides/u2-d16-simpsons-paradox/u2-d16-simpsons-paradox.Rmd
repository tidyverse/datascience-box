# Case study: Berkeley admission data

---

## Berkeley admission data

- Study carried out by the Graduate Division of the University of California, Berkeley in the early 70â€™s to evaluate whether there was a gender bias in graduate admissions.
- The data come from six departments. For confidentiality we'll call them A-F. 
- We have information on whether the applicant was male or female and whether they were admitted or rejected. 
- First, we will evaluate whether the percentage of males admitted is indeed higher than females, overall. Next, we will calculate the same percentage for each department.

## Data

.pull-left[
```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ucbadmit %>%
  print(n = 15)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ucbadmit %>%
  count(gender)

ucbadmit %>%
  count(dept)

ucbadmit %>%
  count(admit)
```
]

---

.question[
What can you say about the overall gender distribution? Hint: Calculate the following probabilities: $P(Admit | Male)$ and $P(Admit | Female)$.
]

```{r}
ucbadmit %>%
  count(gender, admit)
```

---

```{r ucbadmit-overall-prop}
ucbadmit %>%
  count(gender, admit) %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  mutate(prop_admit = n / sum(n))
```

- $P(Admit | Female)$ = 0.304
- $P(Admit | Male)$ = 0.445

## Overall gender distribution

.question[
What can you say about the gender distribution by department ?
]

```{r}
ucbadmit %>%

.question[
Let's try again... What can you say about the gender distribution by department?
]

```{r}
ucbadmit %>%

## Gender distribution, by department

## Closer look at departments

## Simpson's paradox

- Not considering an important variable when studying a relationship can result in **Simpson's paradox**
- Simpson's paradox illustrates the effect that omission of an explanatory variable can have on the measure of association between another explanatory variable and a response variable
- The inclusion of a third variable in the analysis can change the apparent relationship between the other two variables

# Aside: `group_by()` and `count()`

---

## What does group_by() do?

`group_by()` takes an existing data frame and converts it into a grouped data frame where subsequent operations are performed "once per group"

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucbadmit
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>% 
  group_by(gender)
```
]

---

## What does group_by() not do?

`group_by()` does not sort the data, `arrange()` does

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>% 
  group_by(gender)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>% 
  arrange(gender)
```
]

---

## What does group_by() not do?

`group_by()` does not create frequency tables, `count()` does

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>% 
  group_by(gender)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>% 
  count(gender)
```
]

---

## Undo grouping with ungroup()

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>%
  count(gender, admit) %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  mutate(prop_admit = n / sum(n)) %>%
  select(gender, prop_admit)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>%
  count(gender, admit) %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  mutate(prop_admit = n / sum(n)) %>%
  select(gender, prop_admit) %>%
  ungroup()
```
]

---

## count() is a short-hand

`count()` is a short-hand for `group_by()` and then `summarise()` to count the number of observations in each group

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>%
  count(gender)
```
]

---

## count can take multiple arguments

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>%
  group_by(gender, admit) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucbadmit %>%
  count(gender, admit)
```
]

---

## `summarise()` after `group_by()`

- `count()` ungroups after itself
- `summarise()` peels off one layer of grouping by default, or you can specify a different behaviour


```{r message=TRUE}
ucbadmit %>%
  group_by(gender, admit) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 
```
